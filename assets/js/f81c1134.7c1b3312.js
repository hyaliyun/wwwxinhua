About free API services, build API, Upgrade my plane, Latest offer for API, Read more\\n\\nAnyone who can code and deploy an API can be a provider regardless of the legal status of the entity. So you can be a provider as a person or as a company. API applications will be reviewed and be accepted only if they meet our requirements.\\n\\nYou can submit your application for review from this page.\\n\\nAPILayer is an open API marketplace but a carefully curated one. We accept all kinds of APIs. Currently, there are machine learning APIs, financial data APIs, URL shorteners, and many others. We try to handpick the best API available for a single purpose and market and eliminate duplicate projects. We also accept APIs similar to the ones already listed if several features are different and fundamentally better or marketed to different target segments.\\n\\nSubscription fees are totally up to you. The provider decides on pricing; however, APILayer might suggest changes to increase sales and adjust prices according to market conditions.\\n\\nThe description should preferably be under 250 words for better readability.\\nThe description should briefly explain how the API works. You may include the operating logic, queried libraries or algorithms used.\\nThe description should mention any official sources or certifications regarding the data in the responses.\\nA sample request and response should be provided in text or image format.\\nUse cases should be listed to show subscribers how they can make good use of your API.\\n\\nThis depends on how you position your API in the market. If you provide a solution to a critical need and are the only developer to provide that solution: we bet revenue will skyrocket.\\n\\nThe payout is handled on a monthly basis. If the provider is a company, an invoice must be created for APILayer for the amount distributed to the provider. If the provider is a person, they don\'t need to provide an invoice and the payments are sent directly to the given bank account.\\n\\nYes! You can submit your application on this page. If accepted, you can list your API and start earning. The payout will be handled without an invoice and the money will be transferred directly to your bank account.\\n\\nAbsolutely not. All intellectual property regarding your API is protected by our provider agreement and none is transferred to APILayer. We also provide non exclusivity for the providers so they can monetize their work in whichever environment they like."},{"id":"/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3","source":"@site/blog/2023/09-29-preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3/index.mdx","title":"Downgrading","description":"Downgrading a subscription","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Maintenance","permalink":"/blog/tags/maintenance"}],"readingTime":0.585,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer, This Week In React editor","url":"https://thisweekinreact.com","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/slorber"},"description":"A freelance React and React-Native developer near Paris and Docusaurus maintainer.
